Project Description: BeanByte Café – Online Coffee Shop

BeanByte Café is an Android-based online coffee shop application developed using Android Studio and the Kotlin programming language.
The application provides users with a smooth and user-friendly platform to browse, explore, and purchase a variety of coffee products directly from their mobile devices.

The app displays coffee categories and popular items using RecyclerView with modern UI components.
Users can view detailed information about each coffee item, including price, description, and images. The application fetches real-time data from Firebase Realtime Database, ensuring that product information is always updated without requiring manual app updates.

BeanByte Café follows the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture, which improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability.
Features such as dynamic data loading, image handling with Glide, and responsive layouts enhance the overall user experience. The app also includes smooth navigation between screens, loading indicators, and error-safe data handling.

Overall, BeanByte Café demonstrates the practical implementation of modern Android development concepts such as Kotlin, Firebase integration,
ViewBinding, and RecyclerView, making it a complete and efficient solution for an online coffee ordering system.
We also connect our project to Firebase.
